# Deep Thoughts
    
## Description

Deep Thoughts is a website where users can upload thoughts and photos to a dashboard. In this project I refactored a MERN application and replaced the back-end API with AWS cloud resources to handle the storage, database, and computing. I replaced the MongoDB database with Amazon DynamoDB. I also used AWS S3 to store static files, specifically the images. The Node.js AWS sdk was used to interface with the AWS services.
